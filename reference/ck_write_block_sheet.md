# Write One Question-Block Sheet

Each question becomes a small table: the question label on top, the
disaggregation variable band under it, then a header row naming every
group with its sample size, then one row per answer category.
Percentages sit on the left panel and the matching counts on the right,
separated by a spacer column, so a figure and its count can be read
without scrolling.

## Usage

``` r
ck_write_block_sheet(
  wb,
  sheet,
  dat,
  blocks,
  block_group,
  value_columns,
  total_columns,
  pal,
  font_name,
  order_per_question = TRUE,
  colour_scale = TRUE,
  max_colour_scale_rules = 250,
  category_width = 46,
  group_width = 14,
  pct_fmt = ck_percent_format(0)
)
```
