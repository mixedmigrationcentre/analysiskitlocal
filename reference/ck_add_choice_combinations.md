# Report Which Combination of Choices Each Respondent Selected

For each question in `combinations`, adds a derived categorical column
recording which of the *chosen* choices that respondent selected,
ignoring everything else they selected. With k choices of interest every
respondent falls into exactly one of 2^k groups, so the categories are
mutually exclusive and exhaustive and the percentages add to 100\\

## Usage

``` r
ck_add_choice_combinations(
  dataset,
  combinations,
  sm_separator = "/",
  sm_child_style = c("auto", "label", "dummy"),
  exclude_choices = NULL,
  ignore_case = TRUE,
  none_label = "None of these",
  joiner = " + ",
  mode = c("any", "only"),
  only_suffix = " only",
  order = c("descending", "ascending"),
  suffix = "_choice_combination",
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- dataset:

  A dataframe (label row already removed).

- combinations:

  A named list: names are select_multiple parents, values are the choice
  labels of interest. Name the choices to get short display labels
  (`c(Economic = "Economic reasons")`); leave them unnamed and the full
  ONA label is used.

- sm_separator:

  Separator between parent and choice. Default `"/"`.

- sm_child_style:

  `"auto"` (default), `"label"`, `"dummy"`.

- exclude_choices:

  Optional choice labels whose pickers leave the base.

- ignore_case:

  Logical. Match labels case-insensitively. Default `TRUE`.

- none_label:

  Row label for respondents who selected none of the listed choices.
  Default `"None of these"`.

- joiner:

  Placed between the display labels of a multi-choice combination.
  Default `" + "`.

- mode:

  `"any"` (default) ignores the choices outside the listed ones.
  `"only"` requires that nothing outside them was selected, and drops
  respondents who mixed a listed choice with an unlisted one.

- only_suffix:

  Appended to each row label under `mode = "only"`, so the strict
  reading is visible in the table itself. Default `" only"`; the
  `none_label` row is left alone.

- order:

  Row order. `"descending"` (default) puts the largest combinations
  first, so the "both" row leads and `none_label` closes. `"ascending"`
  reverses it.

- suffix:

  Appended to the variable name to make the derived column name.

- verbose:

  Logical. Default `TRUE`.

## Value

A list with `dataset` (the derived columns added) and `map` (a dataframe
of `analysis_var`, `combination_column`, `n_choices`, `n_combinations`,
`n_in_base` and `n_mixed_dropped`).

## Details

For `c(Economic = "Economic reasons", Conflict = "Armed conflict, ...")`
that is four rows: *Economic + Conflict*, *Economic* (selected Economic
and not Conflict, whatever else they selected), *Conflict*, and *None of
these*.

Because the result is an ordinary categorical column it then flows
through the normal analysis - overall and across every grouping
variable - with no special casing downstream.

**Two readings of "combination".** `mode = "any"` (the default) ignores
every choice outside the listed ones, so *Economic* means "selected
Economic, did not select Conflict, and whatever else they selected does
not matter". `mode = "only"` is strict: *Economic only* means "selected
Economic and nothing else at all". The strict reading is not
exhaustive - a respondent who selected Economic alongside some choice
outside the list belongs to none of the categories - and those
respondents are dropped from the base. **The result is that
`mode = "only"` reports on a smaller and differently defined base than
every other table in the run**, so the number dropped is returned in the
map as `n_mixed_dropped` and should be footnoted wherever these
percentages are published.

**Denominator.** Only respondents who answered the question are counted:
the parent column is non-blank, or at least one child is selected.
Anyone who was never asked, or asked and left it blank, is `NA` and
drops out - so *None of these* means "answered, but picked none of the
listed choices", not "did not answer". When `exclude_choices` is in
play, respondents who picked an excluded choice also drop out, which
keeps this base identical to the one behind the question's own choice
percentages.

the pattern is taken from the raw selections, before the not-asked mask
is applied.
