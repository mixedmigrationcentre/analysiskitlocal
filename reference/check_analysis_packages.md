# What the Package Needs, and What Is Installed

`need = "required"` means every run uses it and it is installed with the
package. `need = "optional"` means one feature needs it, and that
feature is the survey engine: an analysis row with a `level` set asks
for a confidence interval, which routes that row through srvyr and
analysistools. Leave every `level` cell empty and the fast tabulation
engine handles the whole run, needing neither - and, on a large
disaggregation, taking seconds rather than minutes.

## Usage

``` r
check_analysis_packages()
```

## Value

A data frame with `package`, `need`, `installed`, `version`, `install`
and `purpose`.

## Details

Nothing is installed here. The two optional GitHub packages are not on
CRAN, so the `install` column gives the command to run.
[`load_packages()`](https://mixedmigrationcentre.github.io/analysiskitlocal/reference/load_packages.md)
does the installing.

The roster itself lives in
[`ak_package_roster()`](https://mixedmigrationcentre.github.io/analysiskitlocal/reference/ak_package_roster.md),
so this function and
[`load_packages()`](https://mixedmigrationcentre.github.io/analysiskitlocal/reference/load_packages.md)
cannot disagree about what is optional or where the GitHub packages come
from.

[`load_packages()`](https://mixedmigrationcentre.github.io/analysiskitlocal/reference/load_packages.md)
to install what is missing.
