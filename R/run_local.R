# =============================================================================
# Running an analysis locally
# =============================================================================
#
# The Analysis Kit server function, as one call. The application's Run handler
# does five things in order - check the destination, run the pipeline, capture
# the pipeline's own messages as a log, export, report - and every one of them
# is as useful in a script as it is behind a button. run_analysis_locally()
# does the same five things in the same order.
#
# Two properties of the app are kept on purpose:
#
#   * Nothing is written unless the analysis completes without error. If the
#     analysis succeeds and only the save fails, the results are still
#     returned and the failure is reported as a save failure, so a long run is
#     never thrown away over a bad folder.
#   * The pipeline reports its own progress through message(). Those messages
#     carry the diagnostics an analyst needs - variables skipped, choices
#     excluded, small groups set aside - so they are kept as a run log rather
#     than left to vanish up the console.

#' Run an Analysis Locally, From Two Files to a Results Workbook
#'
#' The whole Analysis Kit workflow as one call: read the dataset and the List
#' of Analysis, check them against each other, run every analysis the workbook
#' asks for across every disaggregation it declares, and write the results to
#' an MMC-branded Excel workbook.
#'
#' @section What it will not do:
#'
#' The run **stops before doing any work** when the List of Analysis has a
#' fatal problem, and the error names every one of them. That is deliberate:
#' the alternative is a workbook full of plausible numbers attributed to the
#' wrong disaggregation. Call [check_analysis_inputs()] first to see the
#' problems without triggering the run.
#'
#' Warnings do not stop a run - they mean less output, not wrong output - and
#' they arrive in `$log`, which is worth reading rather than skipping. A
#' grouping variable absent from the dataset, a `Don't know` label that matched
#' nothing, a town set aside for having four interviews: all of them are
#' warnings, and all of them change what is in the file.
#'
#' @section The output file:
#'
#' Named `analysiskit_<dataset stem>_<YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS>.xlsx`, and an existing
#' file is never overwritten - a second run in the same second gets a `_1`
#' suffix. The workbook's readme sheet records the dataset, the List of
#' Analysis, the disaggregations and every setting that was applied, so a file
#' found six months later can be traced back to what produced it.
#'
#' Pass `output_folder = NULL` to run without writing anything. The results are
#' returned either way.
#'
#' @param dataset A dataset path (`.csv` / `.xlsx`), the list from
#'   [read_analysis_dataset()], or a data frame with the ONA label row still on
#'   top.
#' @param loa A List of Analysis path, or the list from [read_loa_workbook()].
#'   A `.csv` carries no sheets and is read as the `analysis` table alone, so a
#'   configured run needs `.xlsx`.
#' @param output_folder Folder to write the results workbook into. It must
#'   already exist and be writable, and both are checked before the analysis
#'   starts. `NULL` runs the analysis and writes nothing.
#' @param verbose Logical. Print the pipeline's progress as it arrives. The log
#'   is kept in the result either way.
#' @param ... Further arguments for [run_group_analysis_pipeline()], overriding
#'   the workbook. Use for run-time concerns the workbook should not own; a
#'   setting the workbook is meant to carry belongs in its `settings` sheet, so
#'   that the file remains a complete description of the run.
#' @return An object of class `analysis_run`: a list with `results` (the full
#'   pipeline result), `spec`, `dataset`, `coverage`, `problems`,
#'   `output_path`, `log`, `elapsed` and `save_error`. Print it for a summary.

#' What the Package Needs, and What Is Installed
#'

#' package. `need = "optional"` means one feature needs it, and that feature is
#' the survey engine: an analysis row with a `level` set asks for a confidence
#' interval, which routes that row through \pkg{srvyr} and
#' \pkg{analysistools}. Leave every `level` cell empty and the fast tabulation
#' engine handles the whole run, needing neither - and, on a large
#' disaggregation, taking seconds rather than minutes.
#'
#' Nothing is installed here. The two optional GitHub packages are not on CRAN,
#' so the `install` column gives the command to run. [load_packages()] does the
